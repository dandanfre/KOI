                <p><b>Client name:</b> KOI</p>
                <p class ="essay">KOI is a fictive massage business based in Trondheim. The name KOI derives from the well known carp fish, koi. 
                     The fish is often associated with strength of character and perseverance, and KOI wants to make the customers 
                     feel the same after a visit. KOI is striving to help individual customers feel relaxed, revitalized and strong.
                     The business’ main focus is private, individual customers, but KOI also offers 
                     treatment for businesses that want to include KOI’s services in their employee benefits.

                <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
                <p class ="essay">Many massaging businesses have a static and sterile website. KOI wants to be represented in a professional
                     manner on digital platforms reflecting the same zen feeling customers acquire through KOI's treatment. At the same time
                     the website is informative about the different treatments KOI offers and therefore segments clearly between offers meant for
                     private customers, and businesses (see subsection "Business" under "Our Treatments"), thus giving a trustworthy display and easy understanding. In addition, the website should
                     provide customers with the opportunity to provide action, such as ease of booking and a convenient way to communicate
                     with KOI (see "Contact Us").

                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p class="essay">
                    The website's audience is divided into both existing and new customers, and segmented between private individuals and businesses. 
                    Existing customers who know how the site works and know what treatment they want, can jump quickly to the booking- or contact-form within two clicks.
                    As for new customers they will have the opportunity to explore what treatments KOI offers, both private individuals and businesses alike. 
                    The typical customer is in the age group of 25-35, working full-time, quality conscious and comfortable economically.
                    They use massage for the purpose of well-being, getting a break from a hectic day-to-day life and stress, not to treat injury.
                    For businesses it should be easy for them to find KOI's package offers meant for them, so they can provide services as part of their employee benefits.

                <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
                <p class="essay_w_pic">
                    We want our website to be fluent and repsonsive when in use, so that our policy about segmenting between new and regular users remains.
                    Regular users usually know what treatment they want, and since the navigation bar is located at the top of each webpage with a distinct "Book"-button
                    it is easier for this type of users to go head straigth to the booking form, i.e. "Book"- webpage.
                    As for the new users, the navbar at top helps with creating a mental model of how KOI's website is structured, in addition to orientation.
                    Having a navigation bar applies to all of KOI's users making the website more intuitive to use,
                    at the same time helping to avoid annoyances when using it.

                <p class = "essay">
                    In the 3rd part of the project(i.e. P3) we have to support modularity when coding KOI's website.
                    This is in order to avoid writing the same code several times.
                    Repeated items or code snippets will be handled by using external files
                    of JavaScript code. The JS code will be employed to either include and/ or create repeating element(s)
                    for the relevant html-pages. The plan for modularity is as follows:                   
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>index.html loads "<i>navbar_footer_modularity.js</i>"
                        The script creates the NAV-bar and footer form
                        pre-configured objects, where the links will redirect
                        the users to the proper page
                    </li>
                    <li>Using external JavaScript files - no inline scripting. </li>
                    <li>External CSS style sheet - no seperated style files for each pages.</li>
