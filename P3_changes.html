                <h2>Changes made to website</h2>
                <p class ="essay">The changes that have been made are listed down below.
                    The descriptions are divided into changes regarding the four html-files we have implemented, followed by 
                    changes that have been applied to the JavaScript-files, and finally, major changes in the CSS.
                </p>

                <h3>Index.html</h3>
                <p class="essay">Under the "price" section, at the bottom of index.html, we added a description for every treatment listed. In addition to the description,
                    buttons were added to each treatment to fullfill the functional-requirement for available Call-to-action-buttons at each page.
                    The arrow below the KOI-logo at the top of index.html, ended up being static and consists off one arrow.
                    Out of fear for users mistaking underlined headers for being buttons during the usability-testing, we styled h3 element from being underlined to having a font-weight of 600, so users do not make such mistakes.
                    The update was applied to the h3 elements in the section for treatment categories, and the price list at the bottom.
                    Lastly, we swapped the pictures in "Our Treatments" section. In P2 the picture was a bare back with stones on it. Now the picture has been changed to hands with oil. 
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>About_us.html</h3>
                <p class="essay">
                    This page does not have five masseuses as planned in the section “Our masseuses”, we have only four. This because it looks better with symmetry and
                    gives the user some sense of order and clean design. We also deleted the "Our room" caption because this was unnecessary when we have "Our parlor" as
                    a headline.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Contact_us.html</h3>
                <p class="essay"> Not many changes were made to this site. But we chose to make examples of what the user
                    should write in the input fields with a light grey color to make it intuitively and easy to understand.
                    We changed the "Text" input to "Message" because this is what the user actully is going to write in. We
                    also added a green line around the input fields when typing in correct information.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h3>Book.html</h3>
                <p class="essay">
                    The major changes we did to the booking form was using small arrows instead of the big ones that are displayed in the prototype for book.html, in P2.
                    In addition, placeholder text was added for the input- and select-fields to signify the user about format of the input.
                    Placeholders have been implemented in order to assist users filling out the correct information in the form.
                    Lastly we added green-border effects to signify correct input. This way users can go on to the next field.
                    The implementation of red borders for wrong input have been discarded due to the fact that the correct format of input information have aldready been provided by placeholders,
                    keeping the information to a minimum, but yet effective. The final version of the book.html landed on the MVP-version of the form. The ideal-version will have to wait for a revisit in the future.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>General changes to JavaScript</h3>
                <p class="essay">
                    In P2 we listed 6 different js-applications for maintaining a functional website, where some off them were discarded for the website.
                    We did this due to an easier and more effective implementation in CSS. The javascript-functions that were discarded are the:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I. A JavaScript function to make the video on our landing page fade in when the user enters the page.</li>
                        <li>II. A JavaScript function to make a micro animation of arrow pointing downwards in the index page to signify that there is more content on the page</li>
                    </ul>
                
                <p class="essay"><b>Changes to 1st required book_feedback.js:</b>
                     The JavaScript function for a fake "booking submitted”-message" when booking a treatment
                     have not gone through major changes. The only time this function is triggered is when the user have
                     filled out all the required fields (all fields) of the forms.
                     The same function, but with another name was implemented for the contact-form in contact_us.html, and with another message. 
                    
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="essay"><b>Changes to 2nd required index_vid_effect.js:</b>
                    As mentioned above, this was written in CSS. Therefor the js function has been discarded.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="essay"><b>Changes to 3rd required anim_index_arrow.js:</b>
                    As mentioned above, this was written in CSS. Therefor the js function has been discarded.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="essay"><b>Changes to 4th required gallery_carousel.js:</b>
                    No changes were made, because our initial plan worked.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="essay"><b>Changes to 5th pic_hover_effect.js:</b>
                    No changes were made, because our initial plan worked.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="essay"><b>Changes to 6th required arrow_hidden_box.js:</b>
                     A JavaScript function to collaps and expand box-element with information in the our treatments segment. 
                     This javascript-function was listed as the 6th required .js. It has been changed to be the 4th required .js.
                     In addition to the implementation of the function in JavaScript, some additional html and css-styling was necessary in order to realise the js-function.
                     A certain div was filled out in html and styled to be displayed as none. Clicking on the button with the picture of an arrow, resulted in displaying the div with its contents(elements).
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="essay"><b>Additional JavaScript-file map.js and miniMap.js:</b>
                    Google provides a procedure for implementing their Google Maps API.
                    This js-function was therefore not mentioned in the section for required js, since writing our own js-code for this implementation seemed undoable. 
                    As for the working code, our implementation of the Google Maps API works only for Google Chrome, but not for every web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Safari etc.
                    The given requirement stated the website should be working in Google Chrome, hence we chose not to do any further implementation, and we did not have the capacity to do more.
                    miniMap.js works the same way as map.js, but is for rendering Google Maps API in the footer-section.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p class="essay"><b>Additional JavaScript-file contact_feedback.js:</b>
                    We added a "message-sent"-message when the user has sent in a message, to let them know it was successfully sent. This is similar to the message
                    that comes up when you have booked a treatment.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p class="essay"><b>Modularity Requirement:</b>
                    We fulfilled the modularity requirements by using JavaScript. navbar_footer_modularity.js was used to make the navbar(id="header") and the footer(id="footer"). This was included in each page in one div for the navbar and one div for the footer.
                    As for the design of navbar and footer, the navbar did not go through any major changes, other than not implementing underline for active site. The reason is because we felt this would be more of a distraction, than a helpful navigation signifier, but we will test this hypothesis during user-testing. 
                    Footer: We made the text of the content thinner(weight: 200) and smaller(font-size: 20px) to make it fit better in the visual hierarchy.
                    We also included a “map” header above the map to improve the universal design of the page. 

                    We made one stylesheet named style.css that was used to style the whole website.

                <p class ="essay">Everyone did their part during implementation of KOI website. If one of us 
                    was unsure about how to implement the code, we helped each other out.

                    <br><br>
                    Celine B. B. fulfilled her minimum requirements from P2 and made about_us.html
                    and pic_hover_effect.js. She also made map.js and styled about_us.html in CSS,
                    with a little help from Daniel and Celine H. N.
                    <br><br>
                    Celine H. N. fulfilled her minimum requirements from P2 and made contact_us.html
                    and gallery_carousel.js. She also styled contact_us.html in CSS, the green buttons
                    and much of the styling on index.html.
                    <br><br>
                    Ida fulfilled her minimum requirements from P2. She made index.html, implemented the
                    fade-in video-effect in CSS and styled the arrow on the index page in css as well.
                    <br><br>
                    Daniel fullfilled his minimum requirements from P2. He made the booking.html, styled it, and in addition to wrote some
                    additional content for the div index.html for the implementing the arrow_hidden_box.js.
                    He also wrote book_feedback.js, where the code was reused for contact_feedback.js.
                    Lastly, he supervised that the correct files were added and controlled that the KOI-website worked properly before usability testing.
                    <br><br>
                    Khai fullfilled his minimum requirements from P2. He styled the necessary main elements
                    for the website in CSS, which worked as foundation for the styling of the other html-pages. In addition, he did
                    some styling for the navbar and footer which were generated by navbar_footer.js, which he also wrote.
                    The navbar_footer.js fullfills the requirement for modularity.
